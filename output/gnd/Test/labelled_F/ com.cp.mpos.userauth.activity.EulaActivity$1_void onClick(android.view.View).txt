If either party waives any provision of this License Agreement, that waiver is not deemed to be a continuing waiver of the same or any other provision. If any provision of this License Agreement is found to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision will be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law. The remaining provisions of this License Agreement will not be affected thereby, and each of those provisions will be valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted by law. Any rights not expressly granted in this License Agreement are reserved by Licensor. Each associated service provider of Licensor is an intended third party beneficiary of this License Agreement and is entitled to rely upon all rights, representations, warranties and covenants made in this Agreement.', 'Disagree', 'Agree', '<com cp m pos use rau th activity Eula Activity$1 void onClick']
