Many thanks to these great folks. We got the impression that stackoverflow is a virtual brain that knows everything ;-). \nFurther without the inspiration of an already active community for samples like freesound.org the momentum behind our app would not have been that fast. Please support them where you can, this app lives from strong communities sharing free sounds.\n", '<de ul le fx u fx loops About Display Activity void onCreate']
