His first job after college was selling correspondence courses to ranchers; then he moved on to selling bacon, soap and lard for Armour & Company. \n\nAfter saving $500, Dale Carnegie quit sales in 1911 in order to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a Chautauqua lecturer. He ended up instead attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, but found little success as an actor. \n\nUnemployed, nearly broke, and living at the YMCA on 125th Street, he got the idea to teach public speaking, and he persuaded the \"Y\" manager to allow him to instruct a class in return for 80% of the net proceeds. \n\nIn his first session, he had run out of material; improvising, he suggested that students speak about \"something that made them angry\", and discovered that the technique made speakers unafraid to address a public audience. \n\nFrom this 1912 debut, the Dale Carnegie Course evolved. Carnegie had tapped into the average American's desire to have more self-confidence, and by 1914, he was earning $500 - the equivalent of nearly $10,000 now - every week. \n\nPerhaps one of Carnegies most successful marketing moves was to change the spelling of his last name from \"Carnagey\" to Carnegie, at a time when Andrew Carnegie (unrelated) was a widely revered and recognized name. By 1916, Dale was able to rent Carnegie Hall itself for a lecture to a packed house. \n\nHis crowning achievement, however, was when Simon & Schuster published How to Win Friends and Influence People. The book was a bestseller from its debut in 1936. By the time of Carnegie's death, the book had sold five million copies in 31 languages, and there had been 450,000 graduates of his Dale Carnegie Institute. \n\nCarnegies other books include How to Stop Worrying and Start Living (1948). Toward the beginning of his career, Carnegie wrote Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business (1931), which became a standard text. \n\nHis first marriage ended in divorce in 1931. On November 5, 1944, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he married Dorothy Price Vanderpool, who also had been divorced. \n\nCarnegie died November 1, 1955 (aged 66) at his home in Forest Hills, New York. He was buried in the Belton, Cass County, Missouri, cemetery. \n\nIn 1990 Life Magazine recognized Dale Carnegie as one of the 100 most influential people in shaping the American culture in the 20th centaury. \n\n", "<com handy north carnegie Biography: onResume", "<com handy north carnegie Biography: onResume"], "D:\\COSMOS\\output\\py\\Play_win8\\Books_Reference\\com.handynorth.carnegie\\com.handynorth.carnegie.Main.xml": ["How to Win Friends and Influence People", "How to Win Friends and Influence People", "Dale Carnegie Quotes", "Biography", "My Favourites", "About", "<com handy north carnegie Main: onResume", "<com handy north carnegie Main: onResume"], "D:\\COSMOS\\output\\py\\Play_win8\\Books_Reference\\com.handynorth.carnegie\\com.handynorth.carnegie.Quotes.xml": ["How to Win Friends and Influence People", "Dale Carnegie Quotes", "1 - 3", "Act enthusiastic and you will be enthusiastic.", "Any fool can criticize, condemn, and complain - and most fools do.", "Applause is a receipt, not a bill.", "<com handy north carnegie Quotes: onResume", "<com handy north carnegie Quotes: onResume"], "D:\\COSMOS\\output\\py\\Play_win8\\Books_Reference\\com.handynorth.carnegie\\com.handynorth.carnegie.Wisdom.xml": ["How to Win Friends and Influence People", "Fundamental Techniques in Handling People", "Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.", "Give honest and sincere appreciation.", "Arouse in the other person an eager want.", "<com handy north carnegie Wisdom: onResume", "<com handy north carnegie Wisdom: onResume"], "D:\\COSMOS\\output\\py\\Play_win8\\Books_Reference\\com.handynorth.carnegie\\com.handynorth.carnegie.WisdomMenu.xml": ["How to Win Friends and Influence People", "Fundamental Techniques in Handling People", "Six Ways to Make People Like You", "Twelve Ways to Win People to Your Way of Thinking", "Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment", "<com handy north carnegie Wisdom Menu: onResume", "<com handy north carnegie Wisdom Menu: onResume"], "D:\\COSMOS\\output\\py\\Play_win8\\Books_Reference\\com.healthbeckon.mquotes\\com.healthbeckon.mquotes.MainActivity.xml": ["Daily Quote", "\"Who says you need to wait until you 'feel like' doing something in order to start doing it?

DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY FOR THE PRODUCT. THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED WITH ALL FAULTS ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. PPE, ITS LICENSORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, VIRUS FREE, AND ABLE TO OPERATE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED BASIS, THAT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PRODUCT WILL MEET LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT ERRORS IN THE PRODUCT WILL BE CORRECTED, AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT THE PRODUCT IS MERCHANTABLE, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURATE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NEED, OR NON-INFRINGING, UNLESS SUCH IMPLIED WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION. FURTHER, PPE, ITS LICENSORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS DO NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE PRODUCT IN TERMS OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY PPE OR A PPE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF ANY WARRANTY THAT CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. PPE AND ITS LICENSORS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS HAVE NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCT. YOU BEAR THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE AND ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY SERVICE AND REPAIR. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. NO USE OF THE PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PPE OR ITS PRINCIPALS, SHAREHOLDERS, OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, DISTRIBUTORS, SUPPLIERS, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS OR RESELLERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"PPE GROUP\") BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF, AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED. IN ANY CASE, THE PPE GROUP'S ENTIRE COLLECTIVE LIABILITY UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE THE SUM OF THE FEES PAID FOR THIS LICENSE (IF ANY) AND REPLACEMENT OF DEFECTIVE MEDIA OR PROVISION OF A REASONABLY SIMILAR PRODUCT, AS DETERMINED AT PPE'S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF PPE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS THE LIMITATION OF DAMAGES IN SUCH CASES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE PPE GROUP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF: (i) CONTENT PROVIDED BY LICENSEE OR A THIRD PARTY THAT IS ACCESSED THROUGH OR USED WITH THE PRODUCT AND/OR ANY MATERIAL LINKED THROUGH SUCH CONTENT; OR (ii) THE USE OF PLUG-INS OR SKINS DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES AND MADE AVAILABLE ON PPE'S WEBSITE FOR USE WITH THE PRODUCT; OR (iii) ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY IMPROPER OR IMPRUDENT USE OF THE PRODUCT, INCLUDING USE WHILE DRIVING.\n\n8.  The Software contains features and functionality that may use the data connection of your computer or mobile device. Depending on your mobile data plan, you may be charged for data use by your mobile device carrier. While many mobile devices automatically disable data usage when roaming (using your mobile device outside your country or covered area of your carrier) or in other situations, if the data connection is active and you use the Software, it may result in even higher charges.  PPE is in no way responsible or liable for any and all charges you receive from your data plan provider by using the Software.\n\n9. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.  You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by you shall cause PPE irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate and that PPE therefore may obtain timely injunctive relief to protect its rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n10. MISCELLANEOUS.  (a) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter hereof, which may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of PPE. (b) Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Utah, U.S.A., excluding any conflict of law provisions. (c) Licensee expressly agrees that jurisdiction for any claim or dispute relating to or arising out of this Agreement resides exclusively in the federal and state courts of the State of Utah and expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction thereof. (d) This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. (e) If any provision in this Agreement should be held illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent, or severed from this Agreement if no such modification is possible, and other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect, or PPE may at its option instead terminate this Agreement. (f) A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, shall not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. (g) You may not assign or otherwise transfer by operation of law or otherwise this Agreement or any rights or obligations herein. PPE may assign this Agreement to any entity at its sole discretion. (h) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. (i) Neither party shall be in default or be liable for any delay, failure in performance (excepting the obligation to pay) or interruption of service resulting directly or indirectly from any cause beyond its reasonable control.  (j) This Agreement is the complete statement of the agreement and supersedes any proposal or prior communications between PPE and you relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and this Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of PPE.\n\nPPE reserves the right at any time not to release the Product or, if released, to change prices, specifications, features, licensing terms, release dates, general availability, or other characteristics of the release without further notification.  All rights of any kind in the Product that are not expressly granted in this License are entirely and exclusively reserved to and by PPE.\n", "Agree", "Quit", "<com palmer performance Dash Command

Vertifi will defend, indemnify and hold You harmless from any liability arising from any third party claim or proceeding against You to the extent that such claim or proceeding \nis based on an assertion that the Licensed Software infringes any issued United States patent or any trade secret or copyright of any third party; provided, however, that You notify Vertifi promptly in writing of any such claim or proceeding and give Vertifi full and complete authority, information and assistance to defend such claim or proceeding at the expense of Vertifi; and further provided that You give Vertifi sole control of the selection of counsel and the defense of any such claim or proceeding and all negotiations for its compromise or settlement.  Should the Licensed Software become, or in Vertifi's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, Vertifi will have the right, at Vertifi's option and expense, (i) to procure for You the right to continue using the Licensed Software, or (ii) to replace or modify the Licensed Software with a non-infringing version of substantially equivalent function and performance.\n\nINDEMNIFICATION BY YOU.

You may not sublicense or assign this Agreement or any interest or right granted herein without Vertifi's prior written consent.\n\nGOVERNMENT LICENSEE.  The Licensed Software and accompanying documentation were developed at private expense and no part of them is in the public domain.  The Licensed Software is \"Restricted Computer Software\" and \"Commercial Computer Software\" and if You are acquiring the Licensed Software for the United States Government, then it is acquiring only \"restricted rights\" in the Licensed Software and its Documentation, all as defined in the applicable provisions of the Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Such unit will include a \"restricted rights legend\" on the Licensed Software as may be necessary to insure the limitation of rights acquired by the government.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement will not become effective with respect to the United States Government without Vertifi's prior written approval.\n\nEXPORT CONTROLS.  This Agreement is subject to the laws, regulations, orders, and decrees of the United States which may be imposed from time to time restricting the import/export of the Products to/from the United States.

The state or federal courts located in or having jurisdiction over Boston, \nMassachusetts, United States of America will have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to this Agreement.  If any term or condition of this Agreement is or will become invalid or unenforceable, then such part will be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity only without affecting this Agreement's remaining provisions.  Those rights and obligations which by their nature are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement will survive.

The remedies at law of either party in the event of default or impending default by the other party in the performance of any terms of this Agreement will not be adequate, and such terms may be specifically enforced by a decree for specific performance, injunction or other appropriate equitable relief.  The failure of Vertifi to enforce at any time any provision of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor will it affect Vertifi's ability to enforce any provisions of this Agreement.

thereto and may only be amended in writing by the parties.\n", "Refuse", "Accept", "<com Vertifi Mobile Main Activity: onCreateView", "<com Vertifi Mobile Main Activity: onStart", "<com Vertifi Mobile
