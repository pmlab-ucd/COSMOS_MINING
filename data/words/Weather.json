The following information is based on satellite\nimagery, weather observations, radar and meteorological analysis.\n\nBased on 0000 UTC surface analysis and satellite imagery through \n0515 UTC.\n\n...SPECIAL FEATURES... \n\nA cold front enters the discussion area near 32N61W and \ncontinues SSW to 25N62W to the NE coast of Hispaniola near \n19N70W. Gale force SSW winds are N of 25N within 120 NM east of \nthe cold front over the SW North Atlc. In addition...a surface \ntrough is analyzed W of the cold front from 32N65W to 27N66W. \nGale force WNW winds are N of 30N between 66W-70W. Both gale \nareas are forecast to persist until 0000 UTC FRI JAN 27. See \nlatest NWS High Seas Forecast under AWIPS/WMO headers \nMIAHSFAT2/FZNT02 KNHC for more details.\n\n...ITCZ/MONSOON TROUGH...\n\nThe Monsoon Trough extends from the African coast near 08N13W to \n05N18W. The Intertropical Convergence Zone axis extends from \n05N18W to 02N30W to 01N43W to the South American coast near \n01S46W. Isolated moderate convection is from 00N-06N between 35W-\n42W. Scattered moderate convection is from 03S-06N between 42W-\n50W.\n\n...DISCUSSION...\n\nGULF OF MEXICO...\n\nA 1017 mb high is centered over the SE Gulf of Mexico near \n24N85W with 5-10 kt anticyclonic winds. The W Gulf W of 90W has \n20-25 kt southerly return flow. The entire Gulf has fair \nweather. In the upper levels, a broad ridge with axis along 88W \nis producing mostly westerly flow with very strong subsidence. \nExpect a cold front that is presently over central Texas to \nreach the Texas coast this afternoon with 25 kt northerly winds \nbehind the front. Expect the front to extend from S Louisiana to \nTampico Mexico in 24 hours with showers predominately over \nLouisiana. The remainder of the Gulf E of front will then have \n10-15 kt southerly return flow and continued fair weather.  \n\nCARIBBEAN SEA...\n\nA surface trough, the remnants of a cold front, extends from NE \nHispaniola near 19N70W to the SW Caribbean near 11N80W. \nScattered showers are within 90 nm of the trough. 10-15 kt NE \nwinds are over the NW Caribbean W of the trough. 10-20 kt S \nwinds are over the E Caribbean E of the trough. Elsewhere, \nscattered showers are inland over N Colombia and N Venezuela. In \nthe upper levels, a ridge with axis along 88W is producing \nmostly westerly flow with very strong subsidence. Expect the \ntail-end of a cold front, moving to the E, to traverse Puerto \nRico and the Leeward Islands with scattered showers and isolated \nthunderstorms over the next 24 hours.   \n\n...HISPANIOLA...\n\nThe proximity of the front and trough over Hispaniola has \nresulted in broken to overcast low clouds with scattered showers \nover the island. The cold front is expected to continue eastward \nover the island tonight and early Wed before high pressure \nbuilds in across the region with drier conditions expected.\n\nATLANTIC OCEAN...\n\nA cold front is over the W Atlantic from 32N61W to 25N62W to the \nNE coast of Hispaniola near 19N70W. Gales are E and W of front. \nSee above. Scattered moderate convection is within 180 nm E of \nfront N of 25N. Scattered showers are elsewhere within 90 nm E \nof front S of 25N. Broken low clouds are over the W Atlantic W \nof front to 75W. A 1022 mb high is over the central Atlantic \nnear 29N46W. A cold front extends just N of the area from 34N30W \nto 32N45W. A 1026 mb high is over the E Atlantic N of the Canary \nIslands near 31N17W. Of note in the upper levels, an upper level \ntrough is over the W Atlantic N of 20N between 50W-70W \nsupporting the W Atlantic surface front. Expect the W Atlantic \ncold front in 24 hours to extend from 32N50W to the Leeward \nIslands near 18N61W with convection. Also expect the E Atlantic \ncold front to dip SE and reach the Canary Islands in 24 hours \nwith showers.  \n\nFor additional information please visit \nhttp://www.hurricanes.gov/marine\n\n$$\nFormosa\n\n\n", "Outlook", "ABNT20 KNHC 302341\nTWOAT \n\nTROPICAL WEATHER OUTLOOK\nNWS NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL\n700 PM EST WED NOV 30 2016\n\nFor the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:\n\nTropical cyclone formation is not expected during the next 5 days.\n\nThis is the last regularly scheduled Tropical Weather Outlook of\nthe 2016 Atlantic hurricane season.
